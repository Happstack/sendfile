  sendfile-?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Fixed a bug where Windows would send the whole file with sendFile' if you
    used '0' for count.
  * Converted the foreign calls for windows and linux to 'unsafe' since code
    should be lock-free.
  * Only positive integers are allowed for count now in sendFile' since negative
    is undefined in the portable sense.

  sendfile-0.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * The signature for sendFile' has changed
      it was: Handle -> FilePath -> Int -> Int -> IO ()
      now is: Handle -> Handle -> Int -> IO ()
  * This allows you to pass in a handle instead of a FilePath for the infile and
    since you can now directly manipulate the infile handle, there is no need
    for offset (one can use hSeek).
  * Documentation updated / expanded
  * fileSize function removed (didn't belong)
  * Errors are now wrapped in proper errnos (using Foreign.C.Error for nix and
    Win32.Error for win) and give useful messages on exception.
  * The Module Name has been changed to reflect its function:
      it was: SendFile
      now is: Network.Socket.SendFile

  sendfile-0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * added portable offset + bytecount parameters

  sendfile-0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * A library which exposes zero-copy sendfile functionality in a portable way
